# Schut
A 2D platformer with a arm cannon ability that allows the player to shoot bullets that bounce back and forth around the screen to destroy
specific blocks. But be wary, as those same bullets can bounce back and harm you as well! Your patience is key, and the difficulty is made
almost entirely from your own trigger finger.
